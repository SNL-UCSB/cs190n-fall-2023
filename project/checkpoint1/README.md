# Project Checkpoint 1
For this checkpoint, we want to make sure that you are able to use netUnicorn to collect data and that you have a plan on how you will carry out the data collection for your project.
1. Provide a high-level explanation of the experiment(s) that you want to run through netUnicorn. What type of data do you need to collect?
2. Provide (pseudo)code for the pipeline(s) that you will run for your data collection.
3. For each task in your pipeline, provide a reference to the implementation of this task that you will use for your data collection. Examples of currently implemented tasks can be found [here](https://github.com/netunicorn/netunicorn-library/tree/main/tasks). If you are writing your own tasks, please provide the code for the implementation.
